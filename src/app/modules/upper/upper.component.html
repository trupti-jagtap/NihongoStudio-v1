        <p>
            The N2 and N1 levels are considered the most difficult tests of Japanese reading and listening comprehension. You must be able to understand Japanese used in various daily situations, from sophisticated headlines to coherent conversations at natural speed. You should also be able to freely express yourself in the language casually as well as formally when the situation calls for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The N2 level expects you to know 1,000 kanji and 6,000 vocabulary words. You might find that this exam really begins to test your reading comprehension. Test questions will be subtler compared to the previous, more straightforward levels. You need to exercise your ability to interpret bodies of Japanese text as a whole, as well as how individual parts relate to each other.
